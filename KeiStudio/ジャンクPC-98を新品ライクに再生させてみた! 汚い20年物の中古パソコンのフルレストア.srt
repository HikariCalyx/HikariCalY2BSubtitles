1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,005
曾经有一种计算机在日本流行

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,005
PC-9800 系列

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
它的昵称是 98，在日本人之间非常流行

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,000
曾经几乎 90 % 的日本计算机是 PC-98

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:49,000
到了 90 年代末期，PC-98 的时代结束了
NEC 也就改为生产 PCAT 兼容机

6
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:57,000
你所看到的笔记本就是 PC-98 系列中的一款
（PC-9821Nx，当时售价 560000 円）

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:04,000
这台电脑距离发售已经有二十多年了，成色依然很棒

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
它被一个人翻新了

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
他就是肝杉孝雄

10
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:28,000
在 PC-98 全盛时期，个人计算机是很昂贵的产品
PC-98 昂贵的价格使得很多厂商眼红

11
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
在那时，肝杉孝雄买不起 PC-98

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
然而，肝杉孝雄的一位土豪朋友就有一台 PC-98
机身全白色，有棱有角

13
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
肝杉孝雄十分羡慕，也想要一台 PC-98

14
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
“我是个学生，没有钱，所以我想让我的父母帮我买。”

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
父亲：“PC-98 多少钱？”
肝杉孝雄: "我想便宜的话大概二三十万円。"

16
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
父亲：“别瞎说什么蠢话了。”
于是父亲没有给他买 PC-98

17
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:25,000
看来他的父亲对此感到很遗憾，于是他从办公室带回来一台电脑

18
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:42,000
父亲：“这就是你要的 PC-98。”
肝杉孝雄很高兴，但是等他一开箱他惊呆了

19
00:02:48,000 --> 00:03:02,000
这个 PC-98 的成色很糟糕，有很多烟灰尘土，划痕也很多

20
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
黯淡发黄的液晶屏

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
烟灰撒在机器上的痕迹

22
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:19,000
用倒是能用，但和我期待的完全不一样

23
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
肝杉孝雄很沮丧，但是他并不甘心

24
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,960
为了能将电脑清理干净，我用抹布擦拭

25
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:38,789
然而，就算抹布变脏了，电脑也干净不起来

26
00:03:38,789 --> 00:04:03,253
就算把二手电脑用抹布擦干净了，那顶多也是表面没有灰尘的二手物品

27
00:04:03,253 --> 00:04:11,908
即便过了十年二十年，肝杉孝雄的自卑情绪依然没有消失

28
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:15,655
此后，他成为了一个社团的成员

29
00:04:15,655 --> 00:04:24,000
他用自己的钱买了一台新电脑，然而并不满意

30
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:34,000
肝杉孝雄经历了多年的经验积累，已经拥有了足够的动手能力

31
00:04:35,000 --> 00:05:02,000
我已经学会了我应该要做的，我觉得我现在应该可以把 PC-98 翻修得跟新的一样

32
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:18,000
他决定通过自己的能力动手翻新 PC-98 来消除自己的自卑情绪

33
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
自卑情绪就是翻新的动力

34
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
黯淡的液晶屏

35
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
发黄肮脏的键盘

36
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
电解电容也漏液了

37
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
有人打趣说：这根本就不是二手电脑

38
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,000
这是废品ww

39
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:08,000
会毁掉软盘的软驱

40
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
光驱音乐跑偏，托盘推不回去

41
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,000
处理的时候排线裂开了

42
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
处理的时候外壳酥了

43
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
复活吧！98！！

44
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:44,000
肝杉孝雄去买了用于修复的配件
它不但成色很糟糕，而且还缺少了一些本应连接的配件

45
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:55,000
这个二手 PC-98 没有光驱

46
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:08,000
他在日拍买到的光驱成色并不好
他不能正常听音乐，也不能推仓

47
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:21,000
在市面上能买到的 PC-98 配件和他年纪差不多大
“我感觉我简直就是从负数开始……”

48
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
他调整了光驱的激光头

49
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
他还让开仓退仓过程变得顺滑了

50
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:41,000
这就修好了，坑就开始了，他并没有弃坑

51
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:53,000
他开始拆开他的 PC-98，但是他对做什么一脸茫然

52
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:02,000
主板覆盖满了烟灰，他仔细做了清理

53
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,000
这两块主板上有相当多的电解电容

54
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:26,000
电脑上的电容寿命很短，很快就会漏液，搞不好还会腐蚀主板

55
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
他也觉得这是巨大隐患

56
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:39,000
一些漏液的电容被小心地拆开了

57
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,000
幸好主板没有被腐蚀

58
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:51,000
然后他替换掉了所有的电解电容

59
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
就是得这样……

60
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:05,000
我就一直期待着把它修好，这样就很棒了

61
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:13,000
我已经拆开过一次了，我会面临很多问题的

62
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
哈？就这么详细？

63
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:30,000
要花多少时间来修复？要花多少钱？我能自己修好吗？

64
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,000
我才注意到，要面临的挑战很大，我心里没底。
我真的在做什么可怕的事情吗？

65
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
嗯……就酱

66
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:50,000
他说：当人们想做什么事情的时候这就是他们的动力，
这也就是想得到大家的认可的想法

67
00:09:51,000 --> 00:10:01,000
这是连接本体和显示屏之间的线缆

68
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:12,000
排线上的绝缘胶带已经老化，胶水也开始劣化

69
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:18,000
他就进行清理并重新绑上了新的绝缘胶带

70
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:28,000
用于存放设置和时钟的纽扣型 CMOS 电池也已经被替换

71
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Since it came so far, it was provisionally assembled.
Well, can this start? "Switch finger pressing" trembled.

72
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
As if nothing had happened...
PC-98 is done.

73
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:56,000
"I was very nervous because I had been broken many times before I tried to fix it. hahaha..."

74
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
Takao smiled happily. There was no front teeth there.

75
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Next, He started a tired body case.

76
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:21,000
He polished the entire PC. It is a work of peeling dirty skin.

77
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,000
Suddenly there was an accident. A part of the case was missing.
Plastic that has been 20 years old will deteriorate and weaken.

78
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Of course, even when disassembling, the fastener may be chipped.

79
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
"This is a matter of course, at that time, just repair that part."
Takao was very calm.

80
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The surface is painted finish by airbrush.

81
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,000
The paint was toned by color of the part not damaged.

82
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:10,000
It is mat. But a slight gloss.
He wanted to reproduce elegant skin just like a brand new.

83
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:18,000
The greatest difficulty
"98NOTE" logo

84
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It was formed by many fine thread-like prints.
He anticipated a difficult flight.

85
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:39,000
However, if he leave it alone, PC-98 will never be like a brand new one.

86
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:49,000
"This is a critical moment."
Takao was inspired.

87
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
He got tired of the fine work.

88
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,000
Takao could not do it well, He repeated the failure many times.

89
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:06,000
Every time it failed, He had to peel off all the paint and paint it from the beginning.

90
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
The number of empty paint bottles increased.

91
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:23,000
He bought the same paint, looking for a neighborhood shop.

92
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:46,000
"Fail, but sometimes I knew when I failed.
I thought this was a matter of accuracy. It will be better by overcoming it."

93
00:13:46,000 --> 00:14:05,000
"So I... I had to become a PC myself!
In other words, by myself becoming a precision machine!!"

94
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
"it is ---

95
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
The "98NOTE" logo was reproduced in this way.

96
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:27,000
It is not over yet.
Next is the rubber feet that was once gray. It was dirty and black.

97
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Takao sticks to the same color and shape.
Although he was looking for Akihabara and a DIY store, he could not find it.

98
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:48,000
In the meantime, he found a company that produces custom rubber feet.
He ordered the company as if asking for help.

99
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:57,000
The sensation of a new item increased at once.
He felt the effect of such accessories strongly.

100
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:09,000
The cushion rubber between the display and the main body was similarly dirty.
Besides, it was a state where things like oil seeped out.

101
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:19,000
As the cushion rubber had a simple shape, he cut the gray rubber and made it for himself.

102
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
The keyboard was dirty by the tabacco stain.

103
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He washed it and soaked it in the kitchen bleach.

104
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:44,000
It disappears in the tobacco stain and the color recovers.
However, there was still a used keybord.

105
00:15:46,000 --> 00:16:03,000
Key top that was struck repeatedly with your finger. The surface should have been matte finish.
Unfortunately, however, a dull luster appeared.
The word "beautiful used keybord" was perfect.

106
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
He picked out key tops with shine and got a little matte paint.

107
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Key tops were reborn like new.

108
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Alright. He assembled it and turned on the power. PC-98... revive!

109
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Cruel reality. The exterior, which was reborn like a brand new, made the darkness of the display more prominent.

110
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:46,000
"Even if you fix it, this is a used item"
He felt that the display insisted that way.

111
00:16:48,000 --> 00:17:01,000
He did not give up.
It was fortunate that there were no scratches, cracks, dot missing on the display.
He said that he had to give up play if he had such symptoms.

112
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There really is a PC that can not regain its original form.
I feel sorry but that is reality. "

113
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:19,000
As he muttered so, he seemed a little sad.

114
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Degradation of display brightness and color.
It is due to exhaustion of the backlight.

115
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Currently LED backlights are mainstream, but cold cathode tubes were often used at that time.

116
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:47,000
A narrow rod-like glass tube emits light.
It is almost like a fluorescent light source.

117
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:57,000
It is delicate. Moreover, it takes a voltage of several hundred volts.
Handling required attention.

118
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:10,000
"I was very scared, what would I do if I break it?
What would I do if I get an electric shock? I thought so."

119
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:22,000
As I said, Takao laughed proudly this time.
As he became friends, he began to show various expressions.

120
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,000
I exchanged it and caused it to emit light.
The brightness was completely different.

121
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:39,000
It was bright from just after startup.
Yellowish is gone.

122
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Finally He decided to repair the mouse and power adapter.
This is the last spurt.

123
00:18:50,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Glossy parts. Without glossy parts.
He sticked to how to finish the surface.

124
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:15,000
He polished persistently fast.
Usually, this type of gloss can not be produced in the molding process of the factory.
Polish too. He thought so.

125
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
In the case of the mattress, it painted by masking the logo part of the manufacturer.

126
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:37,000
He wiped a black, troubling, serpentine cable over the day.
He used detergent and absolute ethanol, but when it still can not get dirty, He used thinner.

127
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:45,000
The hardened cable regained its suppleness by being clean.

128
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:53,000
When everything was over, he noticed that his palm was cracked.

129
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:06,000
PC-98 finally reproduced. He thought so.
However, trouble occurred when accessing the floppy disk to install the OS.

130
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:19,000
When writing to a floppy disk, a phenomenon occurred that the floppy disk could not be read.

131
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It was when he was disassembling to maintain a floppy disk, relying on the web.

132
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:38,000
He was careless. He broke the flexible cable.
Bad events were overlapping.

133
00:20:38,000 --> 00:21:03,000
"The accessory of PC-98 is an exhausted resource,
I felt strongly the guilt feeling of breaking such accessories
I thought that I did sorry."

134
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:19,000
Fortunately, we were able to obtain a floppy disk drive at a shop dealing with PC-98 accessories.
Even now, there is a shop that maintains and sells PC-98 accessories and main body like this.

135
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:31,000
PC - 98 's accessories are expensive because it is valuable now, not cheap.
But he thought. "I have a group.

136
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:37,000
In this way, his PC-98 was revived.

137
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:49,000
His inferiority complex disappeared with PC tobacco stain and dirt.

138
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
At that time, he had no feeling of joy by what he achieved.

139
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:09,000
He thought he resembled a feeling of security when his work was done everyday.

140
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The light of the morning sun from the window of a few times was bright.

141
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Finally, we tried a few questions to Takao.
Then he invited me to a late night drive.

142
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:44,000
He says his heart will be healed by driving, he will feel honest.
He says the heart will never be disturbed.

143
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:54,000
"Driving will relieve your mind.
I will have the heart of Buddha and answer your questions. "

144
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
We started asking him a question.

145
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:04,000
Q:For Takao, what kind of thing is "new product"?

146
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:14,000
That is the easiest question.
I will win if it is said to the other player that "That is a new PC."

147
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:25,000
However, if I told my opponent, "It's a PC that looks good," I am defeated.
Because it is a praise for used PC.

148
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Q:It was a difficult task. But can not we make it easier as we can do?

149
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:55,000
I think that it would be nice if there was a service that could exchange exterior parts, but at present it is not.
So, there is no other way than we can move our hands.

150
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:06,000
The state of a new article is transient.
And it is very difficult to regain it.

151
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:14,000
Q:Is your PC-98 OS Windows?

152
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I will not install Windows on this PC.
Installing Windows on the PC-98 in the past has become popular.

153
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:36,000
However, it was very poor in cost performance.
I think everyone is scrupulous.

154
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Q:So what is the OS?

155
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
It is NEC version of DOS.

156
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Q:What can you do with that DOS?

157
00:24:49,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I can not do anything in particular. What I can do with this PC-98 can be done with the current general PC.

158
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:07,000
In the first place do not you understand that you did not restore to make something with this PC-98?

159
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Q:Huh? So, why did you restore this PC-98?

160
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:36,000
This is my habit! habit, religion, drag. It is such kind of thing.
It is not a problem you open your mouth!

161
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Q:Regardless of personal computer, is not your front teeth brand new?

162
00:25:48,000 --> 00:26:05,000
He seems to be excited, so I will finish the interview.
Finally I will part with you while watching the opening of PC-98 game.

163
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
Thank you for watching it for a long time!
